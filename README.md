# ProudCity Gravity Forms

This is a private repo because Gravityforms is not 100% opensource.  The root folder is the standard Gravityforms installation. Within `./modules` are the Gravityforms Addons that come standard on the ProudCity Platform.

When updating the PayPal plugins, replace "Rocketgenius_SP" with "ProudCity_SP" to add our PayPal referral code (https://github.com/proudcity/wp-proudcity/issues/275).
